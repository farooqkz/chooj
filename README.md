This is a free(open source) software Matrix client for KaiOS which is going to support VoIP calls. Perhaps voice call is already working, in this case please send a Pull Request to update this README.

Part of this project is done through crowdfunding. About 100 dollars was donated so that I could buy a Nokia 800 Tough and start the project.

Check related BananaHackers blog posts for more information.

### What does work so far?

 - Login process with password works(manually or by scanning a QR code)
 - Chatting works in all rooms. Partially, however.
 - Voice call partially works.
 - Very experimental and unreliable push notification support which you can enable it in Settings
 - The Cow says "Please wait" to you kindly :))

### How to help?

 - Create an issue and report a bug
 - Open a Pull Request and implement some wanted feature or fix some bug
 - Donate to me with cryptocurrency or hardware(Contact me for any of those)
 - Tell others about Chooj
 - Idle in Chooj's Matrix room and help others when necessary
 - Solve one of the [issues](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj/issues) especially creating Chooj a logo
 - Get Farooq something in his [wish list](https://github.com/farooqkz/my-wish-list/blob/main/README.md)
 - ...

### Matrix chatroom for Chooj

This project has got a Matrix room. See badges.

### Nightly builds

 - You can download and sideload ZIP for each time I push stuff from [here](https://farooqkz.de1.hashbang.sh/matrix-client-builds/).
 - **NEW!** OmniSD builds are available there, too!
 - Thanks to hashbang which let's me host stuff there.
 - Old ZIPs will be deleted after a some time.
 - Please allow a few minutes after each commit and the file will show up there.

*NOTE: While I try to test stuff before pushing but you might find some broken builds there. There is no automated test yet.*

### Device compatiblity

This app should work on all KaiOS versions. However it has been also tested on these devices:

 - Nokia 8110 4G(aka The BananaPhone)
 - Nokia 800 Tough
 - Nokia 8000 4g
 - Alcatel Go Flip 3
 - `[Add your own device here]`

### How to build?

The production build is currently broken and you may only use development builds.

 - Install Node v12.x if you haven't
 - Install yarn if you haven't
 - `yarn install` in project's directory
 - `yarn run devbuild` to create a development build(faster build at the cost of heavier bundle)
 - Now you can sideload the application in `build/` to your device.

You can check guides on how to prepare your device for sideloading stuff
and development at the BananaHackers wiki and website linked below:
